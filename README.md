# Revive

The spread of the pandemic has caused a lot of changes in our lifestyle, people fearing to get outside their homes, transportation almost shut down and social distancing becoming all the more important. The fear of travelling has resulted in the hampering of routine checkups. So we bring to you, Revive, a simple web app that helps patients to take their routine checkups from the comfort of their homes without the scare of the virus. Revive helps any patient to connect with the doctor of their choice, from the list of available doctors, and book an appointment according to their convenience.
It has 2 portals, one for the patients requiring the appointment, and the doctors available for consultation. The patients can enter their medical history, any undergoing medication, etc which can be viewed by the doctor if he/she confirms their appointment. The index page of the patient and the doctor shows their upcoming consultations. The doctor is notified if there are any patients requiring their appointment, and have the option to either confirm or deny, which updates the status of consultation on the patient's side.
The doctor can also send the prescription with detailed feedback to the patient after consultation, along with the consultation fee to be paid. The patient can view the feedback in the index page of their portal, which also provides the facility to pay the consultation fee by redirecting them to the Paytm web page.
This is a humble step from our side hoping to bring our world to normalcy with the pandemic on the spread.
